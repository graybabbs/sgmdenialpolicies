I provide SAS code used to analyze sexual and gender minority distress about healthcare denial policies using Healthy Minds Data. Data from the national Healthy Minds Study are aggregated annually and made publicly available to researchers. Anyone interested in working with the data can complete a brief data request form [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG96RypTFpxqOVAtkECv7Rbd7q5taoLi7Rq-BKpCWdkM6DmQ/viewform]. More information about the Healthy Minds Study, including the complete survey questionnaire administered each year, is available on the study website [https://healthymindsnetwork.org/research/data-for-researchers/].
